based on my email, teams messages and files that I have not yet responded to or that have not otherwise been resolved, add them to my to do list, so that I can see what I need to focus on this week.
summarize my emails and team messages for each to do item.
prioritize the list on a scale from 0-5 with 0 being very important and 5 being not important, and include due dates if any
if the priority is 3 or greater, draft an email response
(schedule prompt to repeat daily at 7:30am, excluding Fri, Sat and Sun)
